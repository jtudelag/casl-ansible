= AWS Policy Assignment

AWS Policy assignment can be pain. While perhaps not a minimalist  solution, here is an example set of policies that will allow provisioning to function.

* link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonVPCFullAccess[VPCFullAccess]
* link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonRoute53FullAccess[Route53FullAccess]

Additionally, the following custom policy must be created for provisioning of CloudFormation stacks.

[source,json]

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "Stmt1535729505000",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "cloudformation:*"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:cloudformation:us-east-2:[Insert ARN]:stack/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}

NOTE: Make sure the region matches your target region above and that you insert an ARN that matches your account.
